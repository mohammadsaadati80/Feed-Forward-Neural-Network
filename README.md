# Feed Forward NeuralNetwork 
Computer Assignment #5 Phase 1, Artificial Intelligence Course, University of Tehran

In this project, we implement **Feed Forward neural networks** to classify images.

In Feed Forward neural networks, each image is first flattened and given as a vector as Feed Forward in the input neural networks. Each element of this vector (equivalent to one pixel of the image) is a property for it. Based on these properties and by making nonlinear combinations of them, the network is supposed to adjust the weight of the connections between its layers so that With the least error, correctly predict the corresponding input image class.

In this assignment we will work with a set of ```Persian``` handwritten numbers. The data set includes images from 10 digits 0 to 9 in Persian. There are a total of 102352 images in this dataset. You can read more about the data set and the number of images of each digit in the data set [here](http://farsiocr.ir/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D9%87%D8%AF%DB%8C/).
